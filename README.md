# GLASS
 
The GLASS functions implement the global state space models, which are extensions to the global var (GVAR) model of Pesaran and coworkers. 

It mainly consists in the estimation and specification of state space models (equivalent to ARMA models) for  a partitioning of a set of variables into different regions. In order to satisfy the 
exogeneity assumptions for such models a block lower triangular structure in the corresponding graph is considered. This implies that variables are only allowed to influence 'downstream' variables, but not
upstream. 

These functions have been implemented during the GLASS project financed by the DFG. They build on the SPECM framework for estimation of state space models including co-integration generated in the project EICIP. 
All functions are available without any liability. Use at your own risk.
